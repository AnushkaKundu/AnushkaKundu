### Hi there 👋
I am a full stack developer and a Machine Learning enthusiast. I am also extremely fond of data structures and algorithms. With regard to web applications, I have good experience with ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Firebase, MySQL and MsSQL. I have worked with several machine learning libraries including but not limited to Numpy, Tensorflow and Pytorch and I absolutely love it. My present goal is to make every application I create scalable, lightweight and useful to the real world.


🎓 I’m a Computer Science & Engineering Undergrad at NIT Surat, Gujarat

🔭 I’m currently working on Natural language processing and Computer Vision.

🌱 I’m currently learning system design to accomplish my goal of making scalable, lightweight and useful applications.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on full stack web development projects
